## Git And Github

### Local Version Control (Git)

**⚠️ Attention: You will need to provide a Github Link containing your code for submissions. Please read this thoroughly to familiarize yourself with Github.**

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com)
    - Version control and file version management system.
    - Allows you to maintain consistent versions of code and backtrack when you need to.
    - Useful for collaboration on potentially large code bases with several people.
    - **Git Commands**
        - Used to save, branch, checkout, track, upload, download, share, collaborate, control versions of, revert, delete, nuke your code.
        - [Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
    - Markdown
        - Used to write README.mds (like the one you're reading right now) to provide documentation for your code.
        - [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 

### Online Version Control (Github)

1. [Github](https://github.com)
    - The most popular web-based hosting service for version control using Git.
    - Offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git along with some of its own features.

## Video Submissions

### Submitting a Video

**⚠️ Attention: You will need to provide a video link depicting your project in order to be considered for prizes.**

You may upload them on youtube and then add it to your Devpost submission.

## Environment

### Terminal 

The **terminal** on your computer, when the right resources are installed, is a powerful tool for running your code and building applications. Changes are, the factory settings on your hacking machine aren't going to cut it to streamline building your application/idea.

The following is a list of tools/technologies to help you turn your ordinary computer into a _certified_ **hacking** **_machine!_**

#### Common Terminal Commands

1. [Common Terminal Commands](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands) that will help you familiarize yourself with navigating and using the terminal.

#### MacOS 

1. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
    - A MacOS specific IDE used to build Apple only software such as iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS apps.
    - Includes numerous general purpose languages and tools for many kinds of projects.
    - Install the [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) as well to make using the terminal easier.
2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
    - The best package manager available for MacOS
    - Allows your install anything else you might need that was not included in Xcode.
    - Once installed, try out `brew install neofetch` then afterwards, run `neofetch` for a cool little display of your computer's stats.
3. [Zsh](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/iTerm/zsh.html)
    - This is the current default Unix shell built on top of [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for MacOS Mojave and above.
    - You can do a lot of cool customizations with Zsh to help you feel more like a hacker such as the following:
        - [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) which allows you to manage your Zsh config. 

#### Windows

1. [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
    - The recently released Windows Terminal allowing you to do everything you can on a Linux/Unix machine.
2. [Ubuntu Subsystem](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
    - Linux subsystem that allows you to run an emulated instance of Linux Ubuntu right within your powershell.

#### Linux

1. Because of the sheer amount of different Linux distros that exist, please refer to your OS documentation on how to install packages for your specific system. You likely will not need a third party package manager since it is usually built into the terminal functionality.

#### Vim/Vi

1. Use the command `vim <file name>` (without the angle brackets) to open the file up in vim/vi without leaving the terminal. This allows your edit your files on the fly without opening up an entire application.
2. [Cheat Sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com)

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

IDEs allow you to take code editing to another level. IDEs provide thousands of plugins to make coding easier and more enjoyable along with the countless themes to really personalize your coding environment.

#### Code Editors

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) is probably the most popular IDE out there for code editing.
2. [Atom](https://atom.io) is another popular IDE.
3. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com)
